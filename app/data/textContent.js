    "I’m a self-taught developer with a background in branding, storytelling, and digital strategy. Before I started writing code, I was crafting brand experiences-thinking deeply about how things look, feel, and function. That creative mindset still drives my work today. My path into programming grew from a curiosity to build, to understand how things work behind the screen. Since then, I’ve become fluent in tools like React, Django, and Docker, and I’m continually exploring the intersection of thoughtful design and scalable architecture. That blend of creativity and systems thinking began in my previous career and that’s where the story starts.",
